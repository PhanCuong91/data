Applying the calculatiom to our case, you know the value of current row 2 (month column) and value 1 PRECEEDING offset, then result of value of the row before current row 1 = 2 (from current row) - 1 (from PRECEEDING offset). next step, you have to calculate the value of row after the current row by FOLLOWING offset + the value of current row, the result is 4 = 2 (from FOLLOWING offset) + 2 (from current row). After the simple calculation you have a range from 1 to 4, then we are looking for all rows that has month column with value from 1 to 4 and city column is 'Paris'.

    "Understanding the window frame (ROWS, RANGE, GROUPS) is crucial when working with window functions in SQL. The window frame can be a bit tricky to grasp at first, but it’s an essential concept to master. In a future post, I’ll cover other important functions such as AVG, MAX, MIN, LAG, and RANGE. For now, let’s focus on the window frame and how it works"
